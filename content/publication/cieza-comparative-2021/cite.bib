 abstract = {Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) has a significant disease burden on society. Noroviruses, rotaviruses, and astroviruses are important viral causes of AGE but are relatively understudied enteric pathogens. Recent developments in novel biomimetic human models of enteric disease are opening new possibilities for studying human-specific host-microbe interactions. Human intestinal enteroids (HIE), which are epithelium-only intestinal organoids derived from stem cells isolated from human intestinal biopsy tissues, have been successfully used to culture representative norovirus, rotavirus, and astrovirus strains. Previous studies investigated host-virus interactions at the intestinal epithelial interface by individually profiling the epithelial transcriptional response to a member of each virus family by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Despite differences in the tissue origin, enteric virus used, and hours post infection at which RNA was collected in each data set, the uniform analysis of publicly available datasets identified a conserved epithelial response to virus infection focused around "type I interferon production" and interferon-stimulated genes. Additionally, transcriptional changes specific to only one or two of the enteric viruses were also identified. This study can guide future explorations into common and unique aspects of the host response to virus infections in the human intestinal epithelium and demonstrates the promise of comparative RNA-seq analysis, even if performed under different experimental conditions, to discover universal and virus-specific genes and pathways responsible for antiviral host defense.},
