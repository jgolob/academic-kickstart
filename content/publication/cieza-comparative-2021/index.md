abstract: Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) has a significant disease burden on society.
  Noroviruses, rotaviruses, and astroviruses are important viral causes of AGE but
  are relatively understudied enteric pathogens. Recent developments in novel biomimetic
  human models of enteric disease are opening new possibilities for studying human-specific
  host-microbe interactions. Human intestinal enteroids (HIE), which are epithelium-only
  intestinal organoids derived from stem cells isolated from human intestinal biopsy
  tissues, have been successfully used to culture representative norovirus, rotavirus,
  and astrovirus strains. Previous studies investigated host-virus interactions at
  the intestinal epithelial interface by individually profiling the epithelial transcriptional
  response to a member of each virus family by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Despite differences
  in the tissue origin, enteric virus used, and hours post infection at which RNA
  was collected in each data set, the uniform analysis of publicly available datasets
  identified a conserved epithelial response to virus infection focused around \"type
  I interferon production\" and interferon-stimulated genes. Additionally, transcriptional
  changes specific to only one or two of the enteric viruses were also identified.
  This study can guide future explorations into common and unique aspects of the host
  response to virus infections in the human intestinal epithelium and demonstrates
  the promise of comparative RNA-seq analysis, even if performed under different experimental
  conditions, to discover universal and virus-specific genes and pathways responsible
  for antiviral host defense.
