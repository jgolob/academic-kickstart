abstract: 'Abstract  Background Human Herpes Virus 7 (HHV7) infection results in a
  lifelong latent infection with over 95% of adults seropositive for HHV7. Lymphocytes
  are the best understood host cell type for latent HHV7, with the gastric mucosa
  another site of latent infection. Herpesviridae latency affects host processes like
  interferon signaling, antigen presentation, and proliferation—the same host pathways
  are implicated in the beneficial responses to commensal microbes.   Methods Adult
  human colonic organoids with or without latent HHV7 infection were co-cultured with
  B. longum in asymmetric oxygen conditions that allow for live interaction (F1).
  The transcriptional state after 24h of interactions was determined with RNA-sequencing.
  The transcriptional state was compared between axenic (no microbes) or after co-culture
  and with or without latent HHV7. F1: Establishing oxygen gradients across epithelial
  monolayers (A) Schematic of oxygen gradient apparatus (B) Closeup view of individual
  well (C) Growth of the anaerobe B. longum was identical in the apparatus with hypoxic
  epithelial compared to full anaerobic growth (D) Butyrate administration protects
  the epithelium from inflammatory effects of deoxycholate.   Results Screening human
  intestinal organoids (that lack lymphocytes and are strictly of the endodermal lineage)
  we have generated evidence that intestinal stem cells (ISC) and IEC can be a host
  cell for latent HHV7 infection in some but not all people (T1). RNA-sequencing reveals
  that this is true latency, with ISC and IEC containing HHV7 without transcripts
  from any of the protein-coding genes in the HHV7 genome. Further we have observed
  that latent HHV7 is mosaic in the gut, not affecting all of the ISC in an individual
  (T1). In organoid-derived human IEC we have noted co-culture with the commensal
  bacteria B. longum suppresses key executors of apoptosis and pyroptosis (F2). These
  same effects are no longer observed with the B. longum is interacting with IEC latently
  infected with HHV7. A similar pattern was observed with NFkB regulators (F3). T1:
  Latent HHV7 is found in some intestinal organoids derived from healthy adults From
  the University of Michigan Translational Tissue Modeling Laboratory (TTML) organoid
  registry. Each donor is assigned a unique numerical ID. Viral panel is from a commercial
  multiplex PCR screen. Notably, donor 87 has colonic organoids with and without latent
  HHV7. F2: Co-culture with the commensal microbe B. longum suppresses most apoptosis
  and pyroptosis executors only in an organoid without latent HHV7 infection. Fragments
  per kilobase per millions of reads (FPKM) from RNA-sequencing of fully-differentiated
  organoid-derived human intestinal epithelium after 24 hours of co-culture with B.longum
  (Orange) or remaining axenic (without microbes; Blue). Results from cell without
  (left) or with (right) latent HHV7. F3: Stimulation of the NFkB inhibitor NFKBIA
  by co-culture with the commensal microbe B. longum is absent in organoids with latent
  HHV7 infection. Fragments per kilobase per millions of reads (FPKM) from RNA-sequencing
  of fully-differentiated organoid-derived human intestinal epithelium after 24 hours
  of co-culture with B.longum (Orange) or remaining axenic (without microbes; Blue).
  Results from cell without (left) or with (right) latent HHV7.   Conclusion Latent
  HHV7 in the human gut epithelium may attenuate the effect of beneficial microbes
  like B. longum (F4). The evidence for mosaicism of latent HHV7 in the human gut
  adds a spatial aspect to these attenuating effects that could be relevant for specific
  disease processes (e.g. skip lesions in Crohn’s disease). Confirmation of these
  findings, estimating the true prevalence of latent HHV7 in the gut, and identification
  of the HHV7 latency mechanism will be required to understand the full implications
  of these findings. F4: A Model of Latent HHV7 Infection Attenuating Responses to
  Commensal Microbes. Based on our findings, latent HHV7 infection in the intestinal
  epithelium may leave the gut mucosa at increased risk for injury by impairing the
  beneficial response to commensal microbes in a spatially complex manner due to the
  apparent mosaic nature of latent HHV7 infection in the gut.   Disclosures Jonathan
