abstract: 'STUDY OBJECTIVES: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and other sleep disorders
  overlap with co-morbidities associated with poor outcomes related to SARS-CoV-2
  infection. However, the prevalence of OSA among patients hospitalized for COVID-19
  and relationship to outcomes is poorly characterized, and the relevance of other
  sleep disorders remains unknown. The objective of this study was to identify the
  prevalence of pre-existing sleep disorders and association with outcomes related
  to severe COVID-19 illness. METHODS: Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted
  to the University of Michigan Hospital System were included. Electronic medical
  records were queried for sleep disorders diagnostic codes. Data was extracted from
  polysomnography and home sleep testing in a subgroup with previous diagnostic testing
  at our center. Logistic regression was used to examine the association of sleep
  disorders with mechanical ventilation requirement, treatment with vasopressors,
  and death, and Cox proportional hazards regression for time to discharge. RESULTS:
  Among N=572 adult patients hospitalized for COVID-19, 113 (19.8%) patients had OSA,
  4 patients had central sleep apnea (CSA) (0.7%), 5 had hypoventilation (0.9%), 63
  had insomnia (11.0%), and 22 had restless legs syndrome or periodic limb movements
  disorder (RLS/PLMD) (3.9%). After adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and race, no significant
  relationship was apparent between sleep disorders diagnoses or indices of sleep
  disordered breathing severity and outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study
  to determine the prevalence of OSA and other sleep disorders in a well-characterized
  cohort of patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Once hospitalized, a significant contribution
  of sleep disorders to outcomes was not identified. Therefore, future evaluations
  should focus on earlier outcomes, such as infection or clinical manifestations after
  exposure to SARS-CoV-2.'
