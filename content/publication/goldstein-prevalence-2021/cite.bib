 abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and other sleep disorders overlap with co-morbidities associated with poor outcomes related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the prevalence of OSA among patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and relationship to outcomes is poorly characterized, and the relevance of other sleep disorders remains unknown. The objective of this study was to identify the prevalence of pre-existing sleep disorders and association with outcomes related to severe COVID-19 illness.
METHODS: Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to the University of Michigan Hospital System were included. Electronic medical records were queried for sleep disorders diagnostic codes. Data was extracted from polysomnography and home sleep testing in a subgroup with previous diagnostic testing at our center. Logistic regression was used to examine the association of sleep disorders with mechanical ventilation requirement, treatment with vasopressors, and death, and Cox proportional hazards regression for time to discharge.
RESULTS: Among N=572 adult patients hospitalized for COVID-19, 113 (19.8%) patients had OSA, 4 patients had central sleep apnea (CSA) (0.7%), 5 had hypoventilation (0.9%), 63 had insomnia (11.0%), and 22 had restless legs syndrome or periodic limb movements disorder (RLS/PLMD) (3.9%). After adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and race, no significant relationship was apparent between sleep disorders diagnoses or indices of sleep disordered breathing severity and outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to determine the prevalence of OSA and other sleep disorders in a well-characterized cohort of patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Once hospitalized, a significant contribution of sleep disorders to outcomes was not identified. Therefore, future evaluations should focus on earlier outcomes, such as infection or clinical manifestations after exposure to SARS-CoV-2.},
