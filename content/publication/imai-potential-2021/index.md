abstract: Oral conditions are relatively common in patients with inflammatory bowel
  disease (IBD). However, the contribution of oral maladies to gut inflammation remains
  unexplored. Here, we investigated the effect of periodontitis on disease phenotypes
  of patients with IBD. In all, 60 patients with IBD (42 with ulcerative colitis [UC]
  and 18 with Crohn's disease [CD]) and 45 healthy controls (HCs) without IBD were
  recruited for this clinical investigation. The effects of incipient periodontitis
  on the oral and gut microbiome as well as IBD characteristics were examined. In
  addition, patients were prospectively monitored for up to 12 months after enrollment.
  We found that, in both patients with UC and those with CD, the gut microbiome was
  significantly more similar to the oral microbiome than in HCs, suggesting that ectopic
  gut colonization by oral bacteria is increased in patients with IBD. Incipient periodontitis
  did not further enhance gut colonization by oral bacteria. The presence of incipient
  periodontitis did not significantly affect the clinical outcomes of patients with
  UC and CD. However, the short CD activity index increased in patients with CD with
  incipient periodontitis but declined or was unchanged during the study period in
  patients without periodontitis. Thus, early periodontitis may associate with worse
  clinically symptoms in some patients with CD.
