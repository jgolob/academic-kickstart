abstract: The human microbiome is complex, variable from person to person, essential
  for health, and related to both the risk for disease and the efficacy of our treatments.
  There are robust techniques to describe microbiota with high-throughput sequencing,
  and there are hundreds of thousands of already-sequenced specimens in public archives.
  The promise remains to use the microbiome both as a prognostic factor and as a target
  for precision medicine. However, when used as an input in biomedical data science
  modeling, the microbiome presents unique challenges. Here, we review the most common
  techniques used to describe microbial communities, explore these unique challenges,
  and discuss the more successful approaches for biomedical data scientists seeking
  to use the microbiome as an input in their studies. Expected final online publication
  date for the Annual Review of Biomedical Data Science, Volume 6 is August 2023.
  Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates.
