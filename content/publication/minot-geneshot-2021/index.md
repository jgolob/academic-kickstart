abstract: Researchers must be able to generate experimentally testable hypotheses
  from sequencing-based observational microbiome experiments to discover the mechanisms
  underlying the influence of gut microbes on human health. We describe geneshot,
  a novel bioinformatics tool for identifying testable hypotheses based on gene-level
  metagenomic analysis of WGS microbiome data. By applying geneshot to two independent
  previously published cohorts, we identify microbial genomic islands consistently
  associated with response to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-based cancer treatment
  in culturable type strains. The identified genomic islands are within operons involved
  in type II secretion, TonB-dependent transport, and bacteriophage growth.
