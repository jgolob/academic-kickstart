abstract: Roughly 1 year after the first case of COVID-19 was identified and less
  than 1 year after the sequencing of SARS-CoV-2, multiple SARS-CoV-2 vaccines with
  demonstrated safety and efficacy in phase III clinical trials are available. The
  most promising vaccines have targeted the surface glycoprotein (S-protein) of SARS-CoV-2
  and achieved an approximate 85%-95% reduction in the risk of symptomatic COVID-19,
  while retaining excellent safety profiles and modest side effects in the phase III
  clinical trials. The mRNA, replication-incompetent viral vector, and protein subunit
  vaccine technologies have all been successfully employed. Some novel SARS-CoV-2
  variants evade but do not appear to fully overcome the potent immunity induced by
  these vaccines. Emerging real-world effectiveness data add evidence for protection
  from severe COVID-19. This is an impressive first demonstration of the effectiveness
  of the mRNA vaccine and vector vaccine platforms. The success of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine
  development should be credited to open science, industry partnerships, harmonization
  of clinical trials, and the altruism of study participants. The manufacturing and
  distribution of the emergency use-authorized SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are ongoing challenges.
  What remains now is to ensure broad and equitable global vaccination against COVID-19.
