abstract: 'Evaluation of the impact of dietary intervention on gastrointestinal microbiota
  and metabolites after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) is
  lacking. We conducted a feasibility study as the first of a two-phase trial. Ten
  adults received resistant potato starch (RPS) daily from day -7 to day 100. The
  primary objective was to test the feasibility of RPS and its effect on intestinal
  microbiome and metabolites, including the short-chain fatty acid butyrate. Feasibility
  met the preset goal of 60% or more, adhering to 70% or more doses; fecal butyrate
  levels were significantly higher when participants were on RPS than when they were
  not (P textless 0.0001). An exploratory objective was to evaluate plasma metabolites.
  We observed longitudinal changes in plasma metabolites compared to baseline, which
  were independent of RPS (P textless 0.0001). However, in recipients of RPS, the
  dominant plasma metabolites were more stable compared to historical controls with
  significant difference at engraftment (P textless 0.05). These results indicate
  that RPS in recipients of allogeneic HCT is feasible; in this study, it was associated
  with significant alterations in intestinal and plasma metabolites. A phase 2 trial
  examining the effect of RPS on graft-versus-host disease in recipients of allogeneic
  HCT is underway. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT02763033 .'
