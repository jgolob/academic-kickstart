abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are considered to be
  \"vulnerable\" to COVID-19 infection due to immunosuppression. To date, there are
  no studies that compared the disease severity of COVID-19 in SOT recipients with
  nontransplant patients. METHODS: In this case-control study, we compared the outcomes
  of COVID-19 between SOT recipients and their matched nontransplant controls. The
  cases were all adult SOT recipients (N=41) from our academic health center who were
  diagnosed with COVID-19 between 3/10/20 and 5/15/20 using positive reverse transcriptase
  polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV2. The controls(N=121) were matched on age(Â±5years),
  race, and admission status (hospital or outpatient). The primary outcome was death
  and secondary outcomes were severe disease, intubation and renal replacement therapy(RRT).
  RESULTS: Median age of SOT recipients(9-heart, 3-lung, 16-kidney, 8-liver, 5-dual-organ)
  was 60 years, 80% were male and 67% were Black. Severe disease adjusted risk of
  death was similar in both the groups(HR=0.84[0.32-2.20]). Severity of COVID-19 and
  intubation were similar but the RRT use was higher in SOT (OR=5.32[1.26, 22.42])
  compared to non-SOT COVID-19 patients. Among SOT recipients, COVID-19-related treatment
  with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was associated with ten-fold higher hazard of death
  compared to without HCQ (HR=10.62[1.24-91.09]). CONCLUSIONS: Although African-Americans
  constituted one-tenth of all SOT in our center, they represented two-thirds of COVID-19
  cases. Despite high RRT use in SOT recipients, the severe disease and short-term
  death were similar in both groups. HCQ for the treatment of COVID-19 among SOT recipients
  was associated with high mortality and therefore, its role as a treatment modality
  requires further scrutiny.'
