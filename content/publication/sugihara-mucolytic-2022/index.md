abstract: Pathobionts employ unique metabolic adaptation mechanisms to maximize their
  growth in disease conditions. Adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC), a pathobiont
  enriched in the gut mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), utilizes
  diet-derived L-serine to adapt to the inflamed gut. Therefore, the restriction of
  dietary L-serine starves AIEC and limits its fitness advantage. Here, we find that
  AIEC can overcome this nutrient limitation by switching the nutrient source from
  the diet to the host cells in the presence of mucolytic bacteria. During diet-derived
  L-serine restriction, the mucolytic symbiont Akkermansia muciniphila promotes the
  encroachment of AIEC to the epithelial niche by degrading the mucus layer. In the
  epithelial niche, AIEC acquires L-serine from the colonic epithelium and thus proliferates.
  Our work suggests that the indirect metabolic network between pathobionts and commensal
  symbionts enables pathobionts to overcome nutritional restriction and thrive in
  the gut.
