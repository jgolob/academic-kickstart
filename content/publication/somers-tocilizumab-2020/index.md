abstract: 'Abstract  Background Severe COVID-19 can manifest in rapid decompensation
  and respiratory failure with elevated inflammatory markers, consistent with cytokine
  release syndrome for which IL-6 blockade is approved treatment.   Methods We assessed
  effectiveness and safety of IL-6 blockade with tocilizumab in a single-center cohort
  of patients with COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation. The primary endpoint
  was survival probability post-intubation; secondary analyses included an ordinal
  illness severity scale integrating superinfections. Outcomes in patients who received
  tocilizumab compared to tocilizumab-untreated controls were evaluated using multivariable
  Cox regression with propensity score inverse probability weighting (IPTW).   Results
  154 patients were included, of whom 78 received tocilizumab and 76 did not. Median
  follow-up was 47 days (range 28-67). Baseline characteristics were similar between
  groups, although tocilizumab-treated patients were younger (mean 55 vs. 60 years),
  less likely to have chronic pulmonary disease (10% vs. 28%), and had lower D-dimer
  values at time of intubation (median 2.4 vs. 6.5 mg/dL). In IPTW-adjusted models,
  tocilizumab was associated with a 45% reduction in hazard of death [hazard ratio
  0.55 (95% CI 0.33, 0.90)] and improved status on the ordinal outcome scale [odds
  ratio per 1-level increase: 0.58 (0.36, 0.94)]. Though tocilizumab was associated
  with an increased proportion of patients with superinfections (54% vs. 26%; p&lt;0.001),
  there was no difference in 28-day case fatality rate among tocilizumab-treated patients
  with versus without superinfection [22% vs. 15%; p=0.42]. Staphylococcus aureus
  accounted for ~50% of bacterial pneumonia.   Conclusions In this cohort of mechanically
  ventilated COVID-19 patients, tocilizumab was associated with lower mortality despite
  higher superinfection occurrence.'
