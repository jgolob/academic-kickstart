abstract: Microbiota are essential to normal immune development and there is growing
  recognition of its importance to human health and disease and deepening understanding
  of the complexity of host-microbe interactions in the human gut and other tissues.
  Commensal microbes not only can influence host immunity locally through impacts
  of bioactive microbial metabolites and direct interactions with epithelial cells
  and innate immune receptors but also can exert systemic immunomodulatory effects
  via impacts on host immune cells capable of trafficking beyond the gut. Emerging
  data suggest microbiota influence the development of multiple myeloma (MM), a malignancy
  of the immune system derived from immunoglobulin-producing bone marrow plasma cells,
  through the promotion of inflammation. Superior treatment outcomes for MM correlate
  with a higher abundance of commensal microbiota capable of influencing inflammatory
  responses through the production of butyrate. In patients with hematologic malignancies,
  higher levels of diversity of the gut microbiota correlate with superior outcomes
  after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Correlative data support the impact
  of commensal microbiota on survival, risk of infection, disease relapse, and graft-versus-host
  disease (GVHD) after transplant. In this review, we will discuss the current understanding
  of the role of host-microbe interactions and the inflammatory tumor microenvironment
  of multiple myeloma, discuss data describing the key role of microbiota in hematopoietic
  stem cell transplantation for treatment of hematologic malignancies, and highlight
  several possible concepts for interventions directed at the gut microbiota to influence
  treatment outcomes.
