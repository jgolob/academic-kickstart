abstract: "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Even in the absence of inflammation, persistent symptoms\
  \ in Crohn's disease (CD) are prevalent and negatively impact quality of life. We\
  \ aimed to determine whether quiescent CD patients with persistent symptoms ( qCD+symptoms\
  \ ) have changes in microbial structure and functional potential compared to those\
  \ without symptoms ( qCD-symptoms ). METHODS: We performed a prospective multi-center\
  \ observational study nested within the SPARC IBD study. CD patients were included\
  \ if they had evidence of quiescent disease as defined by fecal calprotectin level\
  \ textless 150 mcg/g. Persistent symptoms were defined by the CD-PRO2 questionnaire.\
  \ Active CD ( aCD ), diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS-D ), and\
  \ healthy controls ( HC ) were included as controls. Stool samples underwent whole\
  \ genome shotgun metagenomic sequencing. RESULTS: A total of 424 patients were analyzed,\
  \ including 39 qCD+symptoms, 274 qCD-symptoms, 21 aCD, 40 IBS-D, and 50 HC. Patients\
  \ with qCD+symptoms had a less diverse microbiome, including significant reductions\
  \ in Shannon diversity ( P textless.001) and significant differences in microbial\
  \ community structure ( P textless.0001), compared with qCD-symptoms, IBS-D, and\
  \ HC. Further, patients with qCD+symptoms showed significant enrichment of bacterial\
  \ species that are normal inhabitants of the oral microbiome, including Klebsiella\
  \ pneumoniae (q=.003) as well as depletion of important butyrate and indole producers,\
  \ such as Eubacterium rectale (q=.001), Lachnospiraceae spp . (qtextless.0001),\
  \ and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (qtextless.0001), compared with qCD-symptoms.\
  \ Finally, qCD+symptoms showed significant reductions in bacterial tnaA genes, which\
  \ mediate tryptophan metabolism, as well as significant tnaA allelic variation,\
  \ compared with qCD-symptoms. CONCLUSION: The microbiome in patients with qCD+symptoms\
  \ show significant changes in diversity, community profile, and composition compared\
  \ with qCD-symptoms. Future studies will focus on the functional significance of\
  \ these changes. WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW: Background: Persistent symptoms in quiescent\
  \ Crohn's disease (CD) are prevalent and lead to worse outcomes. While changes in\
  \ the microbial community have been implicated, the mechanisms by which altered\
  \ microbiota may lead to qCD+symptoms remain unclear.Findings: Quiescent CD patients\
  \ with persistent symptoms demonstrated significant differences in microbial diversity\
  \ and composition compared to those without persistent symptoms. Specifically, quiescent\
  \ CD patients with persistent symptoms were enriched in bacterial species that are\
  \ normal inhabitants of the oral microbiome but depleted in important butyrate and\
  \ indole producers compared to those without persistent symptoms.Implications for\
  \ Patient Care: Alterations in the gut microbiome may be a potential mediator of\
  \ persistent symptoms in quiescent CD. Future studies will determine whether targeting\
  \ these microbial changes may improve symptoms in quiescent CD."
