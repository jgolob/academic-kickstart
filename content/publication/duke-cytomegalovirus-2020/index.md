abstract: "BACKGROUND: Viral load surrogate endpoints transformed development of HIV\
  \ and hepatitis C therapeutics. Surrogate endpoints for cytomegalovirus (CMV)-related\
  \ morbidity and mortality could advance development of antiviral treatments. While\
  \ observational data support using CMV viral load (VL) as a trial endpoint, randomized\
  \ controlled trials (RCT) demonstrating direct associations between virologic markers\
  \ and clinical endpoints are lacking. METHODS: We performed CMV DNA polymerase chain\
  \ reaction (PCR) on frozen serum samples from the only placebo-controlled RCT of\
  \ ganciclovir for early treatment of CMV after hematopoietic cell transplantation\
  \ (HCT). We used established criteria to assess VL kinetics as surrogates for CMV\
  \ disease or death by weeks 8, 24, and 48 after randomization and quantified antiviral\
  \ effects captured by each marker. We used ensemble-based machine learning to assess\
  \ the predictive ability of VL kinetics and performed this analysis on a ganciclovir\
  \ prophylaxis RCT for validation. RESULTS: VL suppression with ganciclovir reduced\
  \ cumulative incidence of CMV disease and death for 20 years after HCT. Mean VL,\
  \ peak VL, and change in VL during the first five weeks of treatment fulfilled the\
  \ Prentice definition for surrogacy, capturing textgreater 95% of ganciclovir's\
  \ effect, and yielded highly sensitive and specific predictions by week 48. In the\
  \ prophylaxis trial, viral shedding rate satisfied the Prentice definition for CMV\
  \ disease by week 24. CONCLUSION: Our results support using CMV VL kinetics as surrogates\
  \ for CMV disease, provide a framework for developing CMV preventative and therapeutic\
  \ agents, and support reductions in viral load as the mechanism through which antivirals\
  \ reduce CMV disease."
