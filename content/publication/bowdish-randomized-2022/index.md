abstract: 'RATIONALE: There are limited therapeutic options for patients with COVID-19-related
  acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with inflammation-mediated lung injury.
  Mesenchymal stromal cells offer promise as immunomodulatory agents. OBJECTIVES:
  Evaluation of efficacy and safety of allogeneic mesenchymal cells in mechanically-ventilated
  patients with moderate or severe COVID-induced respiratory failure. METHODS: Patients
  were randomized to two infusions of 2 million cells/kg or sham infusions, in addition
  to standard of care. We hypothesized that cell therapy would be superior to sham-control
  for the primary endpoint of 30-day mortality. The key secondary endpoint was ventilator-free
  survival within 60 days, accounting for deaths and withdrawals in a ranked analysis.
  MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the third interim analysis, the Data and Safety
  Monitoring Board recommended that the trial halt enrollment as the pre-specified
  mortality reduction from 40% to 23% was unlikely to be achieved (n=222 out of planned
  300). Thirty-day mortality was 37.5% (42/112) in cell recipients versus 42.7% (47/110)
  in control patients (RR 0.88;95% CI 0.64,1.21;p=0.43). There were no significant
  differences in days alive off ventilation within 60 days (median rank 117.3 [IQR:60.0,169.5]
  in cell patients and 102.0 [IQR:54.0,162.5] in controls; higher is better). Resolution
  or improvement of ARDS at 30-days was observed in 51/104 (49.0%) cell recipients
  and 46/106 (43.4%) of control patients (OR 1.36;95% CI 0.57, 3.21). There were no
  infusion-related toxicities and overall serious adverse events over 30 days were
  similar. CONCLUSIONS: Mesenchymal cells, while safe, did not improve 30-day survival
  or 60-day ventilator-free days in patients with moderate/severe COVID-related acute
  respiratory distress syndrome. Clinical trial registration available at www. CLINICALTRIALS:
