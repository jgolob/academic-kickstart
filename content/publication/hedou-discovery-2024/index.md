abstract: Adoption of high-content omic technologies in clinical studies, coupled
  with computational methods, has yielded an abundance of candidate biomarkers. However,
  translating such findings into bona fide clinical biomarkers remains challenging.
  To facilitate this process, we introduce Stabl, a general machine learning method
  that identifies a sparse, reliable set of biomarkers by integrating noise injection
  and a data-driven signal-to-noise threshold into multivariable predictive modeling.
  Evaluation of Stabl on synthetic datasets and five independent clinical studies
  demonstrates improved biomarker sparsity and reliability compared to commonly used
  sparsity-promoting regularization methods while maintaining predictive performance;
  it distills datasets containing 1,400-35,000 features down to 4-34 candidate biomarkers.
  Stabl extends to multi-omic integration tasks, enabling biological interpretation
  of complex predictive models, as it hones in on a shortlist of proteomic, metabolomic
  and cytometric events predicting labor onset, microbial biomarkers of pre-term birth
  and a pre-operative immune signature of post-surgical infections. Stabl is available
  at https://github.com/gregbellan/Stabl .
