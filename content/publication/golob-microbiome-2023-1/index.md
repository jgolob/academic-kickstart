abstract: Every year, 11% of infants are born preterm with significant health consequences,
  with the vaginal microbiome a risk factor for preterm birth. We crowdsource models
  to predict (1) preterm birth (PTB; textless37 weeks) or (2) early preterm birth
  (ePTB; textless32 weeks) from 9 vaginal microbiome studies representing 3,578 samples
  from 1,268 pregnant individuals, aggregated from public raw data via phylogenetic
  harmonization. The predictive models are validated on two independent unpublished
  datasets representing 331 samples from 148 pregnant individuals. The top-performing
  models (among 148 and 121 submissions from 318 teams) achieve area under the receiver
  operator characteristic (AUROC) curve scores of 0.69 and 0.87 predicting PTB and
  ePTB, respectively. Alpha diversity, VALENCIA community state types, and composition
  are important features in the top-performing models, most of which are tree-based
  methods. This work is a model for translation of microbiome data into clinically
  relevant predictive models and to better understand preterm birth.
