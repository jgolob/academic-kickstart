As a computational biologist and physician, I specialize in applying AI/ML to enhance human health. With a background in computer science, biomedical engineering, and over two decades in biomedical research, Iâ€™m skilled in developing software and computational workflows. My focus is on creating robust, reproducible, and inclusive AI/ML tools for healthcare, with a goal of translating them to benefit patients and providers. Adept at leading teams, I am adaptable and constantly seeking growth through new experiences.
